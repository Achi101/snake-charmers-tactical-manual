# Security

The software we work on is used in financial applications.  This makes us targets.
The following minimum security practices should be used.

- Use a password manager with strong passwords.
- Don't use browser based password storage or autofilling of passwords.
- Enable Two Factor Authentication (avoid use of SMS in 2FA)
- Setup auto-signing of your git commits

- No password sharing (even for family, close friends, etc)
- Auto-lock machine after a short period (5 minutes) of inactivity
- No shared machine usage (family computer, etc)
- Use pre-boot encryption
- Recommend using a VPN anytime you are on an untrusted network
    - ([ProtonVPN](https://protonvpn.com/) is a good VPN provider)
- Never connect to untrusted devices (USB, etc).  
    - This means any device that you cannot personally account for it's origins.  
    - This means you cannot plug someone else's USB drive into your machine to transfer files.
    - This means you cannot plug someone else's phone into your computer to charge it.
