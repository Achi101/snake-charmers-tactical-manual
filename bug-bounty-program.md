# Guidelines for bug bounty submissions

- An issue will be considered un-claimed until a pull request has been made and
the claim has been approved by a core contributor. Claiming an issue on gitcoin.co is not sufficient.

- A good pull request might open with unit tests before any changes are written. Tests
serve as good examples when discussing the scope of work to be performed.

- Settle expectations early, either in discussion or with tests. This will save you from wasted effort.
Make sure you have understood the parameters of the request before diving in.

- Review the other sections of this tactical guide. Conforming to the team's coding style will help ensure your pull
request will be integrated.

- Some issues may prove to be bigger projects than estimated when the bounty was set. Feel free to make
a case to either increase the bounty or reduce the scope of the request. It is up to a the core team whether an
adjustment will be made.

- The bounty value is set assuming a claimee who is familiar with the code base. In other words, a first time
contributor is expected to take as long as they need to familiarize themselves with the project and the team's
contribution guidelines. This added time is not a sufficient reason to increase the bounty.

- Work will be considered complete when the following items have been met:

    - The submission fulfills all the parameters set forth in the initial discussion.
    - Tests have been written for any bugs described in the issue and/or all new code.
    - The project documentation has been updated to reflect changes to the api.
    - All review requests have been met or resolved.
    - The submission conforms to the team's coding style documented in this
       tactical guide.
    - The change has been approved and merged by a core contributor.
